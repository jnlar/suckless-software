## Suckless software repo
Here's a repository containing my configured [suckless][suckless] programs [*dynamic window manager*][dwm] & [*simple terminal*][st]. I've left the README' in place for both programs as a guide to installation.

**Note:** *my* setup might not be necessarily optimal for *you*, but perhaps there may be things you can take from my setup and implement into your own.
