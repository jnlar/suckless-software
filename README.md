This is a repository containing my configured [suckless][suckless] programs [dynamic window manager][dwm] & [simple terminal][st]. I've left the README' in place for both programs as a guide to installation.

**Note:** *my* setup might not be necessarily optimal for *you*, but perhaps there may be things you can take from my setup and implement into your own.
